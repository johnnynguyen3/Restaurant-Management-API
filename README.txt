To Run:
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Install dependencies by typing'npm i' in appropriate folder
3. Once all dependencies are done installing you want to type in 'npm run run' and it will start the server.

Design Decisions:
I decided to seperate my server file and make a seperate JavaScript file called restaurant-router.js that would take care of my server routing as it would make the code more readable. I also made another JavaScript file used to handle client-sided operations called client.js. Along with those things I also used PUG files to render my pages as I personally prefer it over HTML as it has better readablility and offers some nice features that HTML cannot.
